# cdomkokao-fonts

## Why?
I needed a collection of my favorite fonts and other helper scripts that I had a hard time collecting from other packages on npm.

## What is Included?
This package includes the following fonts:
* gidole
* gidolinya
* monoid
* open sans

Other utilities have been included because I needed a one-stop place to get them.  These are all probably out of date at this point and I am not planning on updating them any time soon.
* angular-animate (not current release)
* angular-route (not current release)
* font-awesome (not current release)
* firebase (not current release)
* jquery snippet script (not sure if this is current release or not)

Please use these only for testing purposes as this package may not stay alive forever and is not intended to be udpated frequently.
